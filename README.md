# IRC Rules


TL;DR  
Don't be a dick.  
Use common sense.  
Respect the privacy of others.

### Base Rules
* Follow the spirit of the rules, not the letter. If you're not sure, ask.


1. **No spam**: this includes repeatedly triggering bots in an excessive manner, "talking to yourself" when no one is participating in the discussion, abusing bots, advertising, or sending meaningless or repeated messages.
2. **Mark NSFW links**: always mark NSFW links clearly.
3. **Don't mock others**: especially reguarding things such as race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
4. **No unauthorized bots**: Sometimes even gonzobot is too much. If you really feel like adding yet another bot, talk to the mod team in #lmrofftopic first.
5. **No long pastes**: Do not paste more than three lines of anything into channel.
6. Interfering with other peoples' ability to use the bots.
7. **No public moderator drama**: Don't get up on a soapbox in open channel about your disagreement with channel staff decisions. We're happy to explain and discuss our choices in private message; but don't air your dirty laundry in public.
8. **Don't be a jerk.**: Statements which are completely hurtful and have no other value will not be tolerated. Offensive jokes can be fine (assuming they're funny); being genuinely hateful is not.


## Punishments
Punishments tend to follow a singular 'path'  
`Warning --> Kick --> Tempban (15 Minutes) --> Tempban (1 Hour) --> Tempban (24 hours) --> Permanent Ban`

This 'path' is completely contextual, and depending on the severity of the rule breaking, the rules and punishments are taken as guidelines. The mod steam has full scretion of all punishments.


If you want to discuss anything about the mod team, be it the decision made by a mod to ban someone, or the way a mod is acting, you can join #lmrofftopic, where we will hear you out.  
Just a added note to the above, PMing individual mods will most likely seen by the rest of the mod team, so honestly its not worth complaining about one mod behind their back.


```
This isn't part of the rules but more of a todo list for topics to talk about when mods get online
